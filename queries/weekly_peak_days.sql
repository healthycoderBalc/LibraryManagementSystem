--Weekly peak days: 
-- The library is planning to employ a new part-time worker. This worker will work 3 days weekly in the library. 
-- From the data you have, determine the most 3 days in the week that have the most share of the loans and display the result of each day 
-- as a percentage of all loans. Sort the results from the highest percentage to the lowest percentage. (eg. 25.18% of the loans happen on Monday...)
